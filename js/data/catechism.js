 * question and answer verbatim. Only typography changed (straight quotes to
 * curly ones, whitespace tidied), plus these corrections of obvious source
 * errors, checked against the received text (OPC / PCA / RPCNA editions):
 *   WSC 48: "the sin of having any other God." -> "the sin of having any other god."
 *   WSC 107: "for ever, Amen. teacheth us" -> "for ever, Amen, teacheth us"
 *
 * The Creeds.json Shorter Catechism carries no Scripture proofs, so every
 * entry's `proofs` array is empty. Proof strings elsewhere use the Creeds.json
 * form ('Rom.11.36', 'Exod.20.4-Exod.20.6'); formatProofRef() makes them readable.
 *
 * Self-contained data module: no imports. The helper functions at the bottom
